# A17CardsWishlistApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.8.
I needed an app to show wich card which cards I miss from a mtg set, to manage my collection.
You can select a set, then click on the cards you don't have and export them to a text list, so you can past it on mkm or dm it.
